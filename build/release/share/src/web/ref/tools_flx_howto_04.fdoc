@h3 How to add source search directories
If you need to add any search directories you can use the
{-I} switch. For example:
@pre
flx -Idir your.cpp fred.flx
@
will add dir to the search paths for C++ headers
and for Felix includes. The C++ searches are for
{your.cpp} and also for the C++ generated from fred.flx.

In other words Felix uses a unified search path for
both Felix and C++ so that you can put Felix files
any place you would put C++.
