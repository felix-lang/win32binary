<h1>Building from Github</h1>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<h3>Python</h3>
<p>The full bootstrapping build requires Python 3.2 or better.
Python 3.1 won't work due to a critial API change.</p>

<h3>Ocaml</h3>
You will need Ocaml 3.11 or better native code compiler.
Felix currently will not work with the bytecode compiler.
</p>

<h3>C++ language level</h3>
Felix tries to build with clang <code>-std=c++11</code>,
and gcc using <code>-std=c++0x</code>. C++11 is mandatory.
Gcc 5.1 should work. Clang 3.7 should work. Note, the Apple
supplied clang available with OSX 10.10 does NOT work.

<h3>Operating System Tools</h3>
On Linux and OSX, Felix requires a couple of standard bin utils including
things like <code>cp</code> and of course <code>make</code>.

<h3>Operating System API</h3>
On Unix and OSX based systems Felix requires Posix API.
On Windows, the standard C library emulations are usually
used for convenience instead of the native Windows APIs.

Felix should also build on Cygwin64 (pretending it is Linux).

<h3>Asynchronous I/O</h3>
Felix does asynchronous socket I/O using one of these event
notification services:
<ul>
<li>Linux: epoll</li>
<li>OSX: kqueue</li>
<li>Most Unices: poll</li>
<li>All Unices: select</li>
<li>Windows: Win32 I/O completion ports</li>
<li>Solaris: Solaris I/O completion ports</li>
</ul>


<h1>Building from Source</h1>
<p>The source build is available if you require the latest code
and meet more stringent requirements. It is the only way to get
a Windows build at this time, you will need to join the mailing list
and get help to get the build to work.</p>

<p>Felix builds on Linux, BSD and OSX. It builds on Windows using MSVC++ as
well. For Windows specific build instructions see <a href="./win.fdoc">here</a>.
For BSD specific build instructions see the &quot;Installing Felix: POSIX (BSD)&quot; 
section of the INSTALL File located in the top level of the felix source distrobution.</p>


<h1>Install location</h1>
<p>Felix can be used after the build is complete without installation.
Installing simply saves longer command names and the need to set
environment variables.</p>

<p>You can put a Felix installation anywhere you like. Just copy 
the <code>build/release</code> directory.<p>

<p>The Unix install location is:
<pre>
/usr/local/lib/felix/felix-&lt;version&gt;
</pre>
where version is the current version. A link should be created:
<pre>
/usr/local/lib/felix/felix-latest
</pre>
by the install process. On windows the install location is:
<pre>
C:\usr\local\lib\felix\felix-&lt;versio&gt;
</pre>
that is, the same as on Unix.<p>

<h2>Initial download</h2>
Then issue these
commands: For registered developers, using SSH:
<pre>
git clone git@github.com:felix-lang/felix.git
</pre>
For everyone else:
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/felix-lang/felix.git
</pre>
then
<pre>
cd felix
</pre>
Now, depending on you platform you need to set PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH for the second stage boostrap and then run the build.
This is done by
<pre>
. buildscript/osxsetup.sh
make
</pre>
on OSX,
<pre>
. buildscript/linuxsetup.sh
make
</pre>
on Linux and
<pre>
buildscript\winsetup.bat
nmake
</pre>
on Windows.

By default, Linux build wll use gcc if found, OSX build will use
clang if found, and Windows always uses CL.EXE. The default
can be change for Linux or OSX by setting the environment variable:
<pre>
FLX_BUILD_TOOLCHAIN_FAMILY=gcc
</pre>
or
</pre>
FLX_BUILD_TOOLCHAIN_FAMILY=clang
</pre>

</pre></p>
<p>Now to install Felix:
<pre>
make install           # sudo password required
</pre>
Felix should now be installed in <pre>/usr/local/lib/felix/felix-1.1.9dev</pre>
the core binary <code>flx</code> in <pre>/usr/local/bin</pre>.
</p>
<p>
All versions of Felix are installed concurrently. If you're finished
using a version you should delete the installation directory.
The binary <code>/usr/local/bin/flx</code> is a copy of the <code>host/bin/flx</code>
in the last install directory.
</p>
<h2>Updating Felix</h2>
To update felix do this:
<pre>
cd felix
git pull
make rebuild 
</pre>
Now you can install as before.  If the build doesn't work properly,
you can clean up with
<pre>
rm -rf build
make build
make rebuild
</pre>
This is even more drastic:
</pre>
git clean -dfx
</pre>

<p>Normally, Felix can rebuild itself. However if the structure 
changes enough, the build tools won't be able to rebuild
the system. This also happens if you're editing code and create
a bug which stops the build tools being built. The makefile
recompiles the build tools using <code>flx</code> in order to
build the system, rather than use the pre-built build tools,
since this is necessary when the build tools themselves are
being upgraded. However this can lead to situation where
a bug breaks the bootstrap process and the only recovery
is to rebuild from scratch.<p>

 
<h2>Alternate rebuild</h2>
<p>There's a second way to rebuild Felix that creates the entire
new system and tests it in directory <code>build-trial</code>
instead of overwriting the system in <code>build</code> as it goes.
<pre>
make bootstrap
</pre>
