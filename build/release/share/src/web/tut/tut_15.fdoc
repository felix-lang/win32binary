@h1 Records
There is another aggregate similar to a tuple except the fields are named:
@felix
  val x = (a=1, b=2.9, c="Hello");
  val y = x;
  println$ x.a + y.a;
  println$ x.b + y.b;
  println$ x.c + y.c;
@
The type of these records are given by:
@felix-unchecked
  (a:int, b:double, c:string)
@
Records can have a any number of components, including 1 and 0.
The record type with zero components is identified with the tuple
with no components, namely @{unit}.
