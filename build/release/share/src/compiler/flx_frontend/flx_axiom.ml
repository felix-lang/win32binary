(*
This module is primarily responsible for generating checks that
test if typeclass axioms hold for instances.

Axiom checks are written by the user in a form, which is effectively
a database: the user writes just

axiom_check (1,2);

for example, and every axiom which can accept two integers is
then evaluated to see if it is true. Note that an axiom check
is an ordinary executable statement, and in particular it can
be put inside a loop to dynamically generate may test cases.

This module gathers all the axioms, and attempt to specialise
each one to each test case:  this is just ordinary overloading,
except that many matches are permitted. Code to evaluate
all the matches is generated along with a diagnostic which
will explain which axiom failed on what case, if that occurs.

In passing I mention that axiom_checks found a bug in my floating
point axiom set by proving to me that floating point addition
and multiplication are not associative.
