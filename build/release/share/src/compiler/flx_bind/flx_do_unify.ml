open Flx_btype_subst

(* returns true if a and b have an mgu,
   and also adds each element of the mgu to
   the varmap if it isn't already present
   this routine is ONLY to be used for
   calculating the return types of functions,
   where we're unifying the type of the
   return statements... probably fails
   for generic functions .. since the two
   kinds of type variables aren't distinguished
   (Fun ret type var is an unknown type, not a
   variable one .. it must be eliminated, but
   type parameters must not be [since they're
   instantiated to multiple values .. ..])
