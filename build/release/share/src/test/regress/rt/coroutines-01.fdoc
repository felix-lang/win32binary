// Coroutine test!
//
// We're going to have two procedures which just
// oscilate between each other. The tricky bit
// is initialisation of the variables.
// We can branch-and-link between labels but
// the entry point of a procedure isn't a label.
var p1 : LABEL;
var p2 : LABEL;

proc co1 () {
  // start here
  println$ "ONE";

  // set our restart point
  &p1 <- label_address entry1;
  
  // now call the other coroutine
  co2;

  // we want it to come back to here
  entry1:>
    println$ "THREE";

  // now we can zig-zag
  branch-and-link (&p2, &p1);

  println$ "FIVE";

  // end properly 
}

proc co2 () {
   // here we got started by co1
   println$ "TWO";

   // since p1 is already set we can just do this now:
   branch-and-link (&p1, &p2);
 
   // and we're back from co1 again
   println$ "FOUR";

   // now just jump out
   goto-indirect p1;

   // no way to ever get here
}

// run coroutines
co1;
