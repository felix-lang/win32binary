(* Heavy inlining routine. This routine can inline
any procedure. The basic operation is emit the body
of the target procedure. We have to do the following to
make it all work.

(1) Each declared label is replaced by a fresh one,
and all jumps to these labels modified accordingly.

(2) Variables are replaced by fresh ones. This requires
making additions to the output bound tables. References
to the variables are modified. Note the parent is the
caller now.

(3) Parameters are replaced like variables, initialised
by the arguments.

(4) Any type variables instantiated by the call must
also be instantiated in body expressions, as well as
the typing of any generated variables.

(5) If the procedure has any nested procedures, they
also must be replaced in toto by fresh ones, reparented
to the caller so that any calls to them will access
the fresh variables in the caller.

Note that the cache of children of the caller will
be wrong after the inlining (it may have acquired new
variables or procedure children).

Note that this inlining procedure is NOT recursive!
Its a flat one level inlining. This ensures recursive
calls don't cause an infinite unrolling, and hopefully
prevent gross bloat.

(* note returns exes in reverse order *)
(* This routine analyses an expression to see if it has  the form

  f a

If so it is replaced by v and a statement v = f a, then
this initialisation is replaced by the body of f
with a replacing the parameter,
where returns are replaced by initialisations of v
and a goto the end of the routine.

Then in the special case the last line of the body
resolves to the form

  v = e'

the expression is replaced by e'. This works by a quirk,
that this code must have come from a sole tail return
in the body. If there were more than one return,
prior returns would be a return to a label after it,
however the inliner doesn't generate the label at the
end for a sole tail return, so we can assume this
is the only return.

The result leaves an expression in a place where
a tail call might be recognized, avoiding a temporary
which prevents simplistic patterns representing data
and control flow. Although its a hack, it is important
to ensure trivial functions have no overhead.

Note this routine, in itself, does NOT rescan anything:
there is no recursion -- other than the recursive traversal
of the original expression, done by the 'aux' function.

      This means the 'special cases' handled must be

      Unfortunately, when inlining a function, we first
      inline into the function, then dump the result and
      rescan it. Consequently the recursion stop applied
      which leaves a direct non-tail self call will be
      rescanned here, and the function will be unfolded
      again .. in that process we also redo the special
      inlining .. infinite recursion. This is stopped
      by the flag which prevents inlining into a function
      more than once .. but that doesn't work if the
      function is cloned.

(* NOTES: this algorithm ONLY WORKS if inlining is attempted
in the corect order. Attempting to inline into children
before parents, when they're mutually recursive, spawns
clones infinitely, because we end up cloning a function
on the exclusion list, but not adding the clone to it.


NOTE!!!! THIS SHOULD BE FIXED NOW. WE NO LONGER
PERMIT INLINING RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS UNLESS THE CALL
IS TO A CHILD. A CALL TO SELF, PARENT OR SIBLING NEVER
DOES INLINING .. AND THERE ARE NO OTHER CASES.

INLINING KIDS IS MANDATORY FOR TAIL RECURSION OPTIMISATION.

So we end up recursing into the clone, and inlining
into it, which spawns more clones which are not
excluded, and haven't been inlined into yet.

This needs to be fixed so the algorithm is proven
to terminate and also be complete.

What we need (and is NOT implemented) is something like this:

Cloning nested functions is should not be needed in general.
If we proceed from leaves towards the root, we can eliminate
from each function any nested children, by simply inlining
them. So only variable children need cloning.

Two things stop this working:

(a) non-inline functions and
(b) recursion.

The current algorithm has been hacked to only handle the
call graph from the roots. It used to consider the useage
closure, however that started to fail when I added
'pre-assigned' slot numbers (AST_index). Doing that meant
the natural order of the set wasn't a topological sort
of the parent-child order.

Unfortunately, the remaining recursive descent doesn't
proceed into noinline functions. Although these shouldn't
be inlined into their caller, that doesn't mean functions
shouldn't be inlined into them. Iterating over the usage
closure ensured noinline functions would still be inlined
into.

Recursive functions are a bit different: they currently
allow inlining, with a recursion stopper preventing
infinite recursion.

Unfortunately with a double nesting like this:

  fun f() { fun g() { fun h() { f(); } h(); } g(); }

trying to inline g into f causes h to be cloned.
But trying to inline f into the clone of h retriggers
the descent, causing the clone to be recloned, and
the recursion stopper doesn't prevent this, since it
isn't the same routine being inlined twice (just a clone
of it ..)

The thing is.. we HAVE to inline the original routine
AND the clone for completeness, since both may be
called independently, so even if we could clone the
recursion stoppers, it wouldn't work.

The only solution I can think of is to guarrantee that
you can only clone a routine that is inlined into
already (as fas as possible) so that no attempt will
be made to inline into the clone either.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Hum.... When I inline A -> B -> C -> A (all kid inlines) the
inline of A into C is done first. This creates clones B' and C'.
When we rescan the code to be put into C, we would try to
inline B' into it, and C' into that .. but C' is a cloned sibling
of C, and not the same function. So we try to inline into C',
and inlining A is allowed there .. which causes an infinite
recursion.
